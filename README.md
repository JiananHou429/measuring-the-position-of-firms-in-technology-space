This code is part of the paper:

Arts S, Cassiman B, Hou J. (2023). Position and Differentiation of Firms in Technology Space. **Management Science** 69 (12): 7253-7265. https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.00282

All data is available from https://zenodo.org/record/5172146. 

If you use the code or data, please cite the paper above.



We include three batches of code:

- The first batch (tfidf.R) shows how to use tfidf to characterize a firm's technology portfolio and calculate the similarity between firm technology portfolios
- The second batch (doc2vec_training.py) shows how to train doc2vec to create patent level embeddings 
- The third batch (doc2vec.R) shows how to use doc2vec to characterize a firm's technology portfolio and calculate the similarity between firm technology portfolios

It is suggested to run the code locally and creating an additional folder called `./data/` in which the data from the Zenodo repository can be downloaded.

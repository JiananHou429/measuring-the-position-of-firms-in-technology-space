We include three batches of code:

- The first batch (tfidf.R) shows how to use tfidf to characterize a firm's technology portfolio and calculate the similarity between firm technology portfolios
- The second batch (doc2vec_training.py) shows how to train doc2vec to create patent level embeddings 
- The third batch (doc2vec.R) shows how to use doc2vec to characterize a firm's technology portfolio and calculate the similarity between firm technology portfolios

We include two batches of code:

- The first batch shows how to use tfidf to characterize a firm's technology portfolio and calculate the similarity between firm technology portfolios
- The second batch shows how to train doc2vec to characterize a firm's technology portfolio and calculate the similarity between firm technology portfolios
